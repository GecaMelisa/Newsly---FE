## Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of the **IT 506 â€“ Software Verification, Validation and Testing** course at IBU.

As part of this course, the application will undergo a structured software testing and quality assurance process, which includes:

- **Static code analysis** to detect early bugs and maintain code quality.
- **Unit testing** of individual methods and services.
- **Integration testing** of service and repository layers.
- **System testing** to validate the entire backend from end to end.
- **Test coverage analysis** using industry tools to measure and improve how much of the code is tested.

The goal is to ensure the application is robust, maintainable, and production-ready while demonstrating proper software verification and validation methodology.
